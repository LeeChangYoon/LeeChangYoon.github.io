                In this project, I discussed the implementation of my own ISA and a calculation program that executes each instruction sequentially. The program follows the traditional computer architecture of von Neumann computer, executing instructions in four phases: Load, Fetch, and Execute. In the Load phase, all instructions from "input.txt" are loaded and stored in the memory array. The Fetch phase retrieves the instructions from memory, decodes them into a set of [opcode operand1, operand2] using IR. In the Execute phase, the program executes the instruction, prints the result to the console screen, and records a log in "output.txt". The execution includes binary arithmetic operations (+, -, x, /), mover instruction (M), halt instruction (H), jump instruction (J), compare instruction (C), and branch instruction (B). The project is divided into four sections: discussing the concepts used in the calculator program, including the instruction set manual; the program structure, discussing the sequence of program execution; details for instructions; and finally, presenting the build environment and image files for the results.

                I implemented the project that describes how a single-cycle microarchitecture works, its implementations, and evaluation. This work is part of a larger project designed to implement the pipelined and optimized multi-cycle microarchitecture that uses the MIPS instruction set. The first step of this project was to specify the requirements for the single-cycle microarchitecture, followed by concepts related to the implementation of the microarchitecture such as Von Neumann Computer, ISA, MIPS, and Data paths. Next, I stated the total data path that was implemented, including the control signal table and program definitions. Then, I described how the data paths and single-cycle MIPS simulator were implemented according to the control signals and program definitions. After executing binary programs using the implemented simulator, I presented the results. Finally, I evaluated the single-cycle simulator based on some assumptions and the flow of the data paths.

                The work presented in this project is the third part of a larger project designed to implement and optimize a microarchitecture that uses the MIPS ISA. I have applied advanced concepts to the former single-cycle microarchitecture to enhance its performance. The first step was to specify the requirements for the pipelined microarchitecture. Second, I moved on to concepts critical to microarchitecture, including multi-cycle microarchitecture, pipelined microarchitecture, performance analysis, data dependency handling, control dependency handling, and branch prediction. Third, I have outlined the data path, which includes the latches, forwarding unit, data hazard detection unit, branch prediction unit, and program definitions. Fourth, I have described how I implemented the data paths and pipelined MIPS simulator according to the hardware components and program definitions. I have also included results obtained by executing binary programs using the implemented simulator. In the end, I have evaluated the pipelined MIPS simulator by comparing its performance with the single-cycle MIPS simulator and the flow of the data paths based on some assumptions.

                I completed the works presented in this project, which is the last part of a larger project aimed at implementing and optimizing a microarchitecture that uses the MIPS ISA. The focus of this project was on discussing the cache operation, implementation, and evaluation in the pipelined microarchitecture to improve its performance. The first step was to specify the requirements for the cache structure, followed by an introduction to concepts such as memory hierarchy, memory locality, performance, types of cache, cache replacement policies, and writeback policies. Next, I stated the program definition for the cache implementation, and described how I implemented the cache with various cache replacements and write-back policies. I also presented some results for each execution of the binary program by the cache MIPS simulator. Finally, I evaluated the cache MIPS simulator by comparing its performance with that of the previous simulator and analyzing the memory latency based on certain assumptions.
