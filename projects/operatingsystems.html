                In this project, I discussed the concepts and methods used in the shell, which is the command interpreter for most operating systems such as LINUX, UNIX, and Windows. I explained that the main function of the shell is to get and execute user-specified commands, and many of the commands manipulate files. I also presented my implementation and the results of the execution of the simple shell (SiSH).          
                </p>

                I implemented the project that explains the concepts of thread, multi-threading, problems in multi-threaded programming, and their solutions. I demonstrated the implementation of the multi-threaded word count program and its results for versions 1 through 3, as well as optimization techniques that improved performance. Finally, I presented the execution time and differences between the number of threads and implementation methods.
                </p>

                In this project, I explained the concepts of process, process scheduling, Inter-process communication (IPC), and CPU scheduling. Then, I applied these concepts to implement a simple scheduling program and presented its results for different scheduling algorithms, such as first-come-first-served (FCFS), shortest job first (SJF), round-robin (RR), and completely fair safe (CFS). Additionally, I showed the performance of each algorithm based on the discussed features. Finally, I presented the execution results of the different scheduling algorithms and compared them.

                <p>
                In this project, I explained the concepts of main memory, including physical and logical memory address, paging, table look-aside buffer (TLB), protection, shared page, hierarchical paging, and swapping. Additionally, I discussed the concept of virtual memory, which includes demand paging, free frame list, performance of demand paging, copy-on-write, and page replacement policies. Then, I implemented the virtual memory (paging) program and evaluated its results for different replacement algorithms, such as random, first-in-first-out (FIFO), least recently used (LRU), least frequently used (LFU), most frequently used (MFU), second chance (SCA), and enhanced second chance (ESCA) algorithms, and sizes of TLB. Finally, I evaluated the performance of each replacement algorithm and the size of the TLB based on the features discussed in a later section and presented the result of the execution of the different replacement algorithms and the size of the TLB.

                In this project, I implemented a simple file system, which involved building a program from scratch with proper assumptions. As this project was an important part of the course, I worked hard to complete it successfully. I was encouraged to ask for help if needed, and the instructor welcomed any questions on the subject. One strict rule was not to copy the code from others, but deep discussion was allowed and encouraged.
                <br>
                <br>
                Additionally, I was highly encouraged to perform extra implementation and analysis. For example, I could implement a user process that requests reading for a specific file, instead of doing simple I/O. I could also implement a file with write operation that requires storage block allocation for additional data, requiring i-node change. Loading directory entry into memory and efficiently searching directory entries were also suggested.
                <br>
                <br>
                There were many topics related to file systems, including I/O, scheduling, and virtual memory. Therefore, I tried to do as much as I could and learn from it. If needed, the instructor could provide specific guidelines.
